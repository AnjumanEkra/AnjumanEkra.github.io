The Relaxing Cat Animation is a simple and calming HTML and CSS project featuring a cute cartoon cat. The cat is made using basic shapes with subtle animations, including moving ears, eyes, and a gentle tail swing, creating a peaceful and serene vibe. The minimalistic design and smooth animations make it a great example of how to bring characters to life using only HTML and CSS.
