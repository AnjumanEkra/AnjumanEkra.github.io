This tribute page honors Dr. Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur and economist renowned for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering microfinance. His work, which provides small loans to the impoverished—especially women—has empowered millions to achieve financial independence and escape poverty. Dr. Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his groundbreaking contributions to economic and social development.
